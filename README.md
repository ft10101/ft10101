## ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning
I'm constantly expanding my knowledge and exploring new technologies. Currently, I'm focused on:
- [Foundations of Cyber Security - Google](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-cybersecurity/): This course offers a comprehensive and professional introduction to cybersecurity, encompassing crucial subjects such as the historical context, job responsibilities, security attacks, frameworks, and commonly used tools. 
- [Social Media Marketing - Meta](https://www.coursera.org/learn/social-media-marketing-introduction/): Immersing myself in the world of social media marketing, learning about platforms, engagement strategies, analytics, and incorporating it into a broader digital marketing approach.

## ðŸš€ Personal Projects
I'm passionate about working on personal projects in my free time. Here are some of the projects I've developed:
- [Project 1](https://github.com/ft10101/Projects/blob/main/Plant_Disease_Detection_using_keras_(Apples).ipynb): Aims to classify images of apple tree leaves into different categories based on the type of apple tree they belong to using various Machine Learning models.
- [Project 2](https://github.com/ft10101/Projects/blob/main/LSTM_model_(shakespare).ipynb): Aims to generate random poetic verses in the style of Shakespeare using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. The model is trained on the works of Shakespeare to capture the patterns and styles present in his writing. This model is then used to generate new verses that maintain the essence of Shakespeare's writing. 
- [Project 3](https://github.com/ft10101/Projects/blob/main/Advance_Math_in_Python.ipynb): Aims to solve advance integration usig python.
